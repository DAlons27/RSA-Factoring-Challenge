"""
Factorize as many numbers as possible into a product of two smaller numbers.
    Usage: factors <file>
        where <file> is a file containing natural numbers to factor.
        One number per line
        You can assume that all lines will be valid natural numbers\
                greater than 1
        You can assume that there will be no empy line, and no space\
                before and after the valid number
        The file will always end with a new line
    Output format: n=p*q
        one factorization per line
        p and q donâ€™t have to be prime numbers
